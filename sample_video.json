          "executive_overview": "This curriculum transforms a comprehensive video game analysis into an intellectual journey through dystopian literature, psychological theory, and philosophical concepts. Using the video essay as a gateway, students will explore George Orwell's totalitarian themes, Carl Jung's psychological theories, Nietzsche's eternal recurrence, and Robert Chambers' weird fiction. The video serves not merely as gaming commentary but as applied cultural criticism, demonstrating how contemporary media engages with classical philosophical and literary traditions. Students will examine how the video analyst applies theoretical frameworks to decode narrative meaning, moving from accessible media analysis to rigorous academic theory.",
